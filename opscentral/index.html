      <h2 class="study__content-title">Balancing solutions and feasibility</h2>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        After laying out user problems, it was clear that our primary issue was rigidity. 
        <span>We had our challenge: "How can we design Reports that adapt to users needs and that gives them control over what they see and use?"</span>
        We wanted to make it possible for customers to query the platform however they pleased.
      </p>

      <p class="study__content-text">
        However, we knew that there were engineering constraints that could limit the level of flexibility we aimed to achieve. Because of this, I laid out 2 approaches that afforded users with different levels of flexibility. We shared these ideas with the wider product team so that together, we could decide what may be achieved in the short term and what to push till after the backend was made more amenable.

        <div class="study__columns-title">
          Approach 1
        </div>
          <p class="study__columns-text">This idea kept the existing pre-generated reports format from Extraswitch but made it easier for customers to find, sort and download them. It also included usability enhancements that addressed many of the identified problems such as complexity with navigation, individual downloads etc.

          Approach 2
        </div>
          <p class="study__columns-text">
            This approach moved beyond pre-generated reports and the plans outlined in Approach 1 to allow users to explicitly determine what they wanted from reports. This idea also included allowing users to directly view reports in app, removing issues related the download only method in one fell swoop.

        With approach 1, we were able to provide users with visualisation, much improved usability, streamlined reporting workflows and better operational efficiency.
