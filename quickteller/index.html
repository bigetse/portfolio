      <h2 class="study__content-title">Prelude</h2>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        In this case study, I do my best to condense 3 years of work on the Quickteller overhaul into a manageable read so bear with me. From its start in October 2021 till my watch ended in October 2024, I served as the lead designer overseeing a team of six through research, the design of the new mobile, web, and USSD apps, all the way to its closed beta release.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="study__content">
      <h2 class="study__content-title">Why overhaul Quickteller</h2>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        Quickteller started as a basic payment app but grew beyond that within a decade. As it grew, challenges caused by design inflexibility and a weak infrastructure grew made it difficult for us to expand unrestrained. We had only one recourse, rebuilding Quickteller from scratch.
      </p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="study__content">
      <h2 class="study__content-title">The overhaul was grouped into two broad stages - Research & Design</h2>
      <ol class="study__content-olist">
        <li><span>Stage 1: Research</span> - Before this project could commence, there was a big question to answer, what form should the new Quickteller take? Research helped us reach an answer. The new Quickteller was going to be a superapp.</li>
        <li><span>Stage 2: Design</span> - After we answered the question in stage 1, we moved on to design keeping in mind that we were laying the groundwork for a superapp.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="study__content">
      <h2 class="study__content-title">Stage one - Research</h2>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        For years it was obvious to the team and leadership that a ground-up overhaul was necessary and we finally got the greenlight. Before that could happen, there was a question to answer: What form should the new Quickteller take? 
      </p>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        Due to its design inflexibility and weak infrastructure, Quickteller was disjointed. Some features/products existed separately because we couldn’t fit them in the mobile and web apps. Some existed only on the web app but as separate apps on mobile and when we could, we fit them in the mobile app.
      </p>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        We had to make a decision. Do we leave Quickteller products scattered about, do we harmonise them or was there another path? We decided to let research guide us. In 3 phases of research (generative, design sprints and evaluative), we uncovered our answer - we were going to build a Quickteller Superapp.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="study__content">
      <h2 class="study__content-subtitle">Generative research</h2>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        We sought to understand how the current execution of Quickteller impacted the business and customers and to gain a deeper understanding of business goals and customer behaviour to help us to uncover opportunities for solutions and innovation.

          Key business insights
        </div>
          <p class="study__columns-text">For the business a few considerations were stressed. Firstly, Quickteller was pivoting from strictly payments to a lifestyle product. Flexibility of the new version was paramount to avoid recreating current issues and with rumors of an IPO floating for years, valuation was also top of mind.
          </p>
      </div>

      <div class="study__columns-highlight">

          Approach 2
        </div>
          <p class="study__columns-text">
            Due to the new lifestyle pivot, we sought to understand customer needs through that lens in addition to understanding their experience with the current product. Insights collected included their heavy reliance on mobile, that they currently cycle through multiple products to meet lifestyle needs and their preference for tailored experiences.
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="study__content">
      <p class="study__content-text">
        After synthesising the data gathered in the research phase, we mapped them to find common themes. These themes led to the 3 product concepts for the new Quickteller. 
      </p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="study__content">
      <h2 class="study__content-subtitle">Design sprints</h2>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        Now armed with three concepts for the new Quickteller app, we initially tried to determine what our pick should be through internal and customer surveys. The results came back inconclusive due to respondents not having a practical understanding of what the concepts meant. 
      </p>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        To solve this, we decided to build models of each one. We leveraged design sprints to structure the creation of the apps, focusing on one model per sprint. We wanted to bring to life the complexities and ease that each app concept could present so that our testing was as accurate as possible. The collaborative nature of design sprints involving cross-functional teams helped us get close. We selected identical flows to design and test for each app because uniformity was the key to ensuring tests were not skewed. 
      </p>
    </div>

        With the models from the sprints, we conducted usability tests and interviews with 30 participants (63.3% current users & 36.7% non-users). The tests took place over 6 days and were both remote and physical.

        At the end of the tests, the superapp won by a large margin of 96.7% with brand trust, ease of use, device storage being key deciding factors. We had our answer, the new Quickteller was to be built as a superapp and we could progress to stage 2 - designing the new Quickteller Superapp

            While designing, I remianed aware of issues that customers had with Quickteller eg. low brand trust. Wwe ensured that this feature provided reassurance, feedback, updates, thereby creating satisfaction and increasing brand trust.

        Lastly, I set up success indicators to monitor that would help us measure the effectiveness of the design after launch. Working with the Data Team, we outlined metrics to monitor that we could not track using Microsoft Clarity alone. Major focus was on monitoring conversion through the feature adoption funnel.

      <h2 class="study__content-subtitle">Exiting the Quickteller Team</h2>
      <p class="study__content-text">
        I left the Quickteller team just after its closed beta release. As a result, I was unable to monitor the impact of our improvements on Quickteller. However, this remains one of the most pivotal projects of my professional career. I learnt a lot about design, advocating for customers, the power of research, managing a team (and myself, really) through a large scale project, managing product managers (6 at once!) and other stakeholders, navigating challenges that I previously thought would break me, and lots lots more. I hope that we were able to achieve the goals that we set for Quickteller and for ourselves.

        A big thank you to all the people I worked closest with on this project. In the research phase, Kene Nwafor (Design), Ayobami Adelugba (Research), Tolu Thomas (Software Engineering), Tayo Winkunle (Product Management) and in the design phase, Wisdom Onyema, Ese Ughulu, Tomi Joshua, Jennifer Daniel, Ridwan Oladimeji (all on design) and Twyla Idigbe, Ayokunbi Akande, Nnenna Okoronkwo, Rita Nicholas and Ebuka Ike-Mgbechi (all on Product Management) and Tolulope Thomas, the lead engineer.
